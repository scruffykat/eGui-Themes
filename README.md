# egui-Themes
A collection of my themes, free for anyone to use. Most themes are made with [egui-themer](https://github.com/grantshandy/egui-themer)

## Full permissions to do what you want
There are no rules, you may use these themes for commercial or personal. You may modify or not; it's up to you! You don't even need to give credit, but it would be nice :)
